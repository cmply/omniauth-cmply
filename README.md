# OmniAuth CMP.LY

This gem contains the CMP.LY strategy for OmniAuth. CMP.LY uses the OAuth 2.0 flow.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
    gem 'omniauth-cmply'
```

And then execute:

```sh
    $ bundle
```
Or install it yourself as:

```sh
    $ gem install omniauth-cmply
```




## Usage

### Rails

If you're using Rails, you need to add the strategy to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
    gem 'omniauth-cmply'
```

or you can pull them in directly from Github e.g.:

```ruby
    gem 'omniauth-twitter', :git => 'https://github.com/cmply/omniauth-cmply.git'
```

Once you've added the gem to your project, you need to add the following to your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :cmply, "consumer_key", "consumer_secret"
    end
```

Enter your `consumer_key` and `consumer_secret`, which you receive when you register your application with CMP.LY (they
call them API Key and Secret Key).

Now just follow the README at: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth

### Sinatra

```ruby
require 'omniauth'
require 'omniauth-cmply'

use Rack::Session::Cookie
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :cmply, "consumer_key", "consumer_secret"
end

get '/auth/:provider/callback' do
  # Do something with auth_hash
  redirect to('/')
end

def auth_hash
  request.env['omniauth.auth']
end
```

## Supported Rubies

OmniAuth CMP.LY is tested under 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3 and Ruby Enterprise Edition.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

- Fork the project.
- Make your feature addition or bug fix.
- Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version unintentionally.
- Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump
  version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
- Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
